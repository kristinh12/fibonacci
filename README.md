Fibonacci

This is an algorithm to create a given number of values of the Fibonacci sequence.  The Fibonacci sequence is formed by starting with the values 0 and 1, and then adding the previous 2 values together: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8...  

There are two solutions, one which uses recursion but is less efficient, and another that finds the sequence iteratively by building an array.
